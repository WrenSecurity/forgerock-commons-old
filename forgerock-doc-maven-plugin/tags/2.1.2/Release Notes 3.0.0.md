# ForgeRock Documentation Tools 3.0.0 Release Notes

# DRAFT - IN PROGRESS

ForgeRock Documentation Tools is a catch all for the doc build plugin,
sites where we post documentation, and the documentation about
documentation. The link to the online issue tracker is
<https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/DOCS>.

This release includes the following changes to the configuration,
improvements & new features, and bug fixes.

## Compatibility

## Improvements & New Features

## Bugs Fixed

**DOCS-156: Configuration of docbkx-plugin is cluttered with repeat elements**



## Known Issues

**DOCS-71: Soft hyphens displayed in mid line in PDF**

See <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-2239>.

Workaround: The problem might arise when you are documenting a synopsis
manually, as the markup is not available in the context where you want
to add a synopsis.

First, you can use `&#8230;` for horizontal ellipsis rather than `...`.

Second, if you have a construction like `.]` where brackets mean
optional, then add an extra space. It's technically wrong, but readers
will have to interpret the optional characters anyway.

**DOCS-132: Soft hyphens used to break lines are rendered in PDF as hyphen + space**

See <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-2358>.

Workaround: Fix the content after copy/paste.
